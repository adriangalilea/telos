# Telos

🚧 Status: WIP

## 📖 Read the Manifesto

**[Intention Is All You Need](./MANIFESTO.md)** - The paradigm shift from HOW to WHAT

I'm currently sharing the conceptual foundation. The manifesto outlines a new way of thinking about programming and self-improving programs - will release implementation soon.

## 👀 How does it look like?

```python
# You define the purpose in plain language in the docstrings, inputs and outputs.
@telos
def analyze_sentiment(text: str) -> SentimentResult:
    """Analyze the sentiment of text."""
    pass

# It works immediately (via AI)
result = analyze_sentiment("I love this!")  # positive (0.98)
# Day 1: $0.01/call, 847ms

# It evolves with use
# Day 30: $0.00001/call, 0.001ms (synthetized solution)
```
Quickly scaffold programs and solve intractable narrow problems immediately with functions that start expensive and slow, then optimize themselves through usage - achieving up to 1,600,000x speedup.

## 🔮 The Vision

Teleological Programming introduces **telos** functions - self-evolving functions that:
- Work from day one using AI
- Learn from every invocation
- Synthesize solutions
- Discover optimal implementations
- Maintain AI fallback

## 💡 Core Concept

```python
# Traditional: You write HOW
def classify(text):
    tokens = tokenize(text)
    features = extract_features(tokens)
    return model.predict(features)

# Teleological: You declare WHAT
@telos
def classify(text: str) -> Category:
    """Classify text into categories."""
    pass  # Implementation discovers itself
```
